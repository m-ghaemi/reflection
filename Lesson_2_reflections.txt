1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when I initialize a repository it creates a new foldet called .git into my repositoryto track my changes.
I need this for knowing the history of changes of my project.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is the area that we keep file there to commit them. I think it separete them in some way.
